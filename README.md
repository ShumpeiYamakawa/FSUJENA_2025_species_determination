# Environmental DNA (eDNA) Metabarcoding 

In this course, you will learn species identification methods based on sequence information, with a particular focus on environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding. The course is divided into three sessions. On Days 1 and 2, the principles and analysis methods of eDNA metabarcoding will be introduced step by step through hands-on exercises. On Day 3, you will apply the methods you have learned to identify species from raw data in a practical exercise, aiming to improve their technical skills.
